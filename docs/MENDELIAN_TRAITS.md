# Mendelian Traits

## Overview

- Mendelian traits are simple and monogenic; they are controlled by **ONE gene only**.
- Other complex or polygenic traits are controlled by **MULTIPLE genes** and can include environmental influence.
- Simple traits = few thousands
- Complex traits = tens of thousands
- Early catalogs from the 80s report around 1900 simple Mendelian traits (McKusick's catalog); these were raised to 4000 when complex traits and genetic diseases are added up.
- The number of traits is likely to be way more than current records; research keeps revealing new observable human characteristics and their links to genetics.
