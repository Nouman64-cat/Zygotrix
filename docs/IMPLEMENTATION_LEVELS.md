# Zygotrix Implementation Levels

This document outlines the practical roadmap for Zygotrix, moving from simple educational genetics models to more complex (and risky) implementations.  
Each level explains **what to implement**, **examples**, and **why it matters**.

---

## **Level 1 ‚Äî Mendelian Playground (‚úÖ Start Here)**

- **What:** Basic single-gene inheritance models.
- **Examples:** ABO blood type, Rh factor, simplified eye color, cystic fibrosis.
- **How:** Punnett squares, dominance/recessiveness, codominance.
- **Why:** This is the foundation of classical genetics. Users learn the golden ratios (3:1, 9:3:3:1).
- **Status:** Already functional in Zygotrix.

---

## **Level 2 ‚Äî Multiple Independent Traits (‚úÖ Safe Expansion)**

- **What:** Simulate multiple single-gene traits at once.
- **Examples:** Blood type + eye color + hair texture simultaneously.
- **How:** Either run Punnett logic per trait or compute joint probabilities (dihybrid crosses).
- **Why:** Demonstrates Mendel‚Äôs law of independent assortment.
- **Goal:** Show users how traits combine without interference.

## **Level 3 ‚Äî Famous Disorders & Real Genes (‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Research)**

- **What:** Connect simulation to real-world genetics data.
- **Examples:**
  - CFTR gene (Chromosome 7) ‚Üí Cystic fibrosis
  - HBB gene (Chromosome 11) ‚Üí Sickle-cell anemia
  - ABO gene (Chromosome 9) ‚Üí Blood group
- **How:** Build a curated dataset (CSV/JSON) of 50‚Äì100 known single-gene traits with chromosome + gene info.
- **Why:** Makes Zygotrix feel biologically grounded instead of purely toy models.

---

## **Level 4 ‚Äî Polygenic Traits (‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced, Approximate)**

- **What:** Add traits influenced by many genes.
- **Examples:** Height, skin tone, risk of diabetes.
- **How:** Use GWAS data (polygenic risk scores). Present results as **probabilities**, not certainties.
- **Why:** Demonstrates the complexity of genetics ‚Äî most real human traits are polygenic.
- **Caution:** Output will always be approximate.

---

## **Level 5 ‚Äî Phenotype Visualization (üöß Ethical & Heavy)**

- **What:** Generate speculative child visuals based on parental traits.
- **Examples:** Face morphs, avatar-style simulations.
- **How:** GANs or diffusion models trained on parent/child face datasets.
- **Why:** Adds strong user appeal and interactivity.
- **Caution:** Ethically sensitive, dataset-hungry, and compute-heavy. Risk of misuse if presented as ‚Äúaccurate prediction.‚Äù

---

## **Level 6 ‚Äî Full Genome Simulation (‚ùå Not Feasible)**

- **What:** Predict real traits/diseases directly from full genome sequences.
- **Examples:** Reading raw ATGC data to simulate an offspring‚Äôs genome.
- **Why not:**
  - Requires full sequencing data.
  - Needs biostatistics and supercomputers.
  - Even then, predictions would remain highly uncertain.
- **Conclusion:** This is beyond Zygotrix‚Äôs scope. Avoid this direction to maintain credibility.

---

## **Suggested Endgame**

- **Practical scope:** Stop at **Level 3‚Äì4**.
  - Level 1‚Äì2 ‚Üí Educational + foundation.
  - Level 3 ‚Üí Biologically grounded (real genes).
  - Level 4 ‚Üí Probabilistic models for polygenic traits.
- **Beyond that** ‚Üí drifts into pseudoscience or research-grade genomics.
